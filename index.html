        <h3><u>Zanzibar in a Brief</u></h3>

        <p>Zanzibar is a Tanzanian archipelago off the coast of East Africa. <br> On its main island, Unguja, familiarly called Zanzibar, is Stone Town, a historic trade center with Swahili and Islamic influences. <br> Its winding lanes present minarets,
            carved doorways and 19th-century landmarks such as the House of Wonders, a former sultan’s palace.
            <br> The northern villages Nungwi and Kendwa have wide beaches lined with hotels.
